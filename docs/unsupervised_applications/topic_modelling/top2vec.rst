Top2Vec

Introduction
------------------------
------------------------

Top2Vec model is an easy to implement state-of-the art model used for unsupervised machine learning that automatically detects topics present in text and generates jointly embedded topic, document and word vectors. The number of dense areas of documents found in the semantic space is assumed to be the number of prominent topics. The topic vectors are calculated as the centroids of each dense area of document vectors.

Important usage of Top2Vec is as follows:
	- Obtaining the number of detected documents 
	- Get content and size of the topics
	- Finding the hierarchy in topics
	- Using keywords to search topics
	- Using topics to search document
	- Using keywords to search documents 
	- Finding similar words
    - Finding the same documents
