Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Introduction
_____________

* **Latent**: Latent refers to anything that is hidden' in the data. In this technique, the topics within the document are not known, but it is assumed that they are present since the text is generated based on the topics.

* **Dirichlet**: Dirichlet is a distribution of distributions.

		  **Example:**
		  Let's say we have a machine that produces dice and each dice will have 6 unbiased sides. Additionally, we can control whether a machine will produce a dice. 
			 
		  In this scenario, the machine producing dice is considered as a distribution since it can produce different types of dice. The dice itself would be a distribution as each dice has 6 possible face values. This is a case of Dirichlet distribution or a 'distribution of distributions'
